# Overview
# This repository contains multiple Python programs that demonstrate various programming concepts, including numerical methods, data visualization, file handling, and command-line operations.

# Contents

# Week02 - bank.py
# Description: Prompts the user for two money amounts (in cents), adds them, and prints the total in a human-readable euro format.
# Concept covered: User input, integer arithmetic, string formatting.
# References: Python input/output operations.

# Week03 - accounts.py
# Description: Reads a 10-character account number and outputs it with only the last 4 digits visible (first 6 replaced by Xs).
# Concept covered: String manipulation, input validation.
# References: Python string slicing.

# Week04 - collatz.py
# Description: Implements the Collatz conjecture, where user inputs a positive integer, and the program repeatedly applies the transformation until reaching 1.
# Concept covered:Loops, conditionals.
# References: Collatz conjecture, Python loops.

# Week05 - weekday.py
# Description: Checks whether today is a weekday or a weekend.
# Concepts Covered: Pythonâ€™s datetime module.
# References: Date handling in Python.

# Week06 - FloatNewton.py
# Description: Approximates the square root of a positive floating-point number using Newton's method.
# Concepts Covered: Numerical approximation, functions, loops.
# References: Newton-Raphson method.

# Week07 - argument.py
# Description: Reads a text file and counts the occurrences of the letter 'e'.
# Concepts Covered: File handling, string methods, command-line arguments.
# References: Python file handling, CLI usage.

# Week08 - plottask.py
# Description: Displays a histogram of a normal distribution (1000 values, mean=5, std=2) and a plot of the function h(x) = x^3 on the same axes.
# Concepts Covered: Data visualization using Matplotlib, numerical calculations using NumPy.
# References: Matplotlib for plotting, NumPy for numerical operations.

# Requirements
# Python 3.x
# matplotlib and numpy (for plottask.py) - pip install matplotlib numpy
